Simon Game
This is a classic Simon game built using jQuery. The game challenges players to repeat an increasing sequence of tones and lights, with the sequence growing longer after each correct round. If the player fails to match the sequence, the game ends.

This project is part of the Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu and focuses on practicing JavaScript and jQuery.
