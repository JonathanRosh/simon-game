# Simon Game

This is a classic Simon game built using jQuery. The game challenges players to repeat an increasing sequence of tones and lights, with the sequence growing longer after each correct round. If the player fails to match the sequence, the game ends.

This project is part of the **Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu** and focuses on practicing JavaScript and jQuery.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Colorful buttons light up in sequence.
- **Audio Feedback**: Each button is paired with a unique sound to help players remember the sequence.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The sequence length increases after each round.
- **Game Over Mechanism**: The game ends when the player makes a mistake.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current score and the highest score achieved (saved using localStorage).

## Technologies Used

- **jQuery**: For DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **Clean Code Principles**: The JavaScript code is structured with clarity and maintainability in mind, making it easy to extend and modify.

## How to Play

1. The game starts automatically when you open the page.
2. Watch the sequence of lights and sounds.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons.
4. The sequence gets longer with each round.
